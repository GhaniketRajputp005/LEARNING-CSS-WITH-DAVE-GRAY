    <!-- Media queries
         in CSS are a way to apply styles based on various characteristics of the device or browser viewing a web page. They allow you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, resolutions, and other features. Media queries are particularly important for creating websites that work well on both desktop and mobile devices. -->
